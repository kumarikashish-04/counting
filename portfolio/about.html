  <h1 id="abt">About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I have completed my Secondary and Higher Secondary education with excellent academic performance, scoring <strong>89%</strong> in 10th and <strong>91%</strong> in 12th grade. Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from  <a href="https://www.lpu.in/"><strong>Lovely Professional University</strong></a>, where I have maintained a CGPA of <strong>8.30</strong>. I am a dedicated and passionate learner, always striving for growth both academically and personally.<br><br>
    I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a strong foundation in web development, problem-solving, and clean code. I enjoy building responsive websites, designing smooth user interfaces, and solving real-world challenges through code.<br><br>
    I have experience working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, and Java. I’ve built multiple personal projects including portfolio websites, mini-games, and data-driven dashboards. I'm constantly learning new technologies and frameworks to stay ahead.<br><br>
    Beyond coding, I’m a curious learner who loves collaborating on tech projects and mentoring peers. I’m currently seeking opportunities to grow as a developer through internships or team-based real-world projects.
